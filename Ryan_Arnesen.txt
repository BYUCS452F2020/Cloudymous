Hey, My name is Ryan Arensen, I am very interested in your project.
I love thinking about security and the all the intricacies of cryptography.\
I've always been a big fan on solving puzzles and your project seems to most align with that desire.
Your project also seems to actually align with the purposes of this class, which is a plus.
If you want to contact me, my email is ryan.d.arnesen@gmail.com

I would like to to fully help develop the secure back-end of the project, including assisiting in making design decisions that benifit security.
I am also decently aware of C and have a good understanding of low level language.

I have to comment on Business, Legal, and Technical so
Business, I appreciate how there is no built in buisness pitch going on here, just research
Legal, It is wise to not advertise something built by students as secure
Technical, I'm quite flexible and can help with whatever is nessisary.
